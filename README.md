# TTUNO

## Object Oriented Programming
### Description 
A local multiplayer UNO game built with a server-side architecture and MVC design pattern, emphasizing Object-Oriented Programming principles. The architecture of the game is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, which separates the game logic, user interface, and user input handling. This separation of concerns makes the codebase more manageable, scalable, and easier to maintain.

### Running and compiling
Run the local server on one machine:
```
./server.sh
```

Run the client(s):
```
./frontend.sh
```


### Results 
Scored a 100% in the project.
